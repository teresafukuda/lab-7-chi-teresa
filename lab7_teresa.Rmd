I'm Teresa and I'm adding some text here to see if my collaborator, Caio, can get this file. 

I'm excited to travel to orlando to see my parents (Caio 2018) 


Creator (Teresa):

Getting gc_df.csv data, loading the tidyverse, and getting some summary counts

```{r}

library(tidyverse)

gc_df <- read_csv("gc_df.csv")

get_guns <- gc_df %>% 
  filter(gender != "NA", make_get_guns != "NA") %>%
  count(gender, make_get_guns) %>% 
  spread(make_get_guns, n) %>% 
  select(-gender) 

rownames(get_guns) <- c("Female", "Male")


```
